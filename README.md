# Simple Programming Refreshers

A variety of different coding brain teasers and a few common interview tests that I have conducted for practicing some of my coding skills. This repository is used as cheat sheets and a reminder for some of the languages I learned over the years. If you are looking for some of my past projects please check the other repositorys that I have in GitHub.
